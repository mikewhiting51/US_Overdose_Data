## Objectives

Objective was to analyze overdose data to determine trends among genders, age groups, ethnicities, and drug type. 

## Findings

1. Drug overdose deaths rose significantly and steadily among all demographic groups and across all drug types between 1999-2018 (255% increase in total deaths per 100,000).
2. 2018 was the first and only year in the dataset when overdoses declined.
3. Overdose deaths remained consistently higher among males, but females experienced a faster annual rate of increase (15% vs 14.2%).
4. Americans aged 15-24 and 25-34 experienced the most significant increase in overdose deaths among all age groups (294% and 374%, respectively).
5. White and Black Americans experienced the most significant increase in overdose deaths among ethnic groups (296% and 165.6%, respectively). 
6. Opioids, particularly heroin, were the driving force in the increase in overdose deaths (600% increase in heroin-related overdose deaths).
